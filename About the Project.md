Smart Traffic Light Management System

Project Overview:
The Smart Traffic Light Management System is an AI-based solution designed to optimize traffic flow at busy intersections using real-time traffic data. This project was developed for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024 by our team, "The Can-Do Crew Hustle".

Problem Statement:
Traffic congestion is a major urban challenge, leading to increased delays and pollution. Our AI-based system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle detection, improving traffic flow and reducing wait times.

Solution & Approach
- YOLO v8 for real-time vehicle detection  
- Dynamic traffic light control based on congestion levels  
- Modular design for scalability and real-world implementation  

Key Features
- AI-powered real-time traffic monitoring
- Dynamic signal adjustment for optimal flow  
- Scalability for different urban intersections
